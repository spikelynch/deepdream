TODO
====

Immediate things to fix:

* fix the messy filenames (no _f0 etc unless multiple frames, default
  to write out 0,1,2,3,4)

* fix octaves with deepdraw <- fixed

* improved output:
  - create a new directory with metadata file containing all frames,
  with an option to switch this off

* library-ise the deepdream code so I can stop using shell scripts

--------------

* default behaviour should be - clean up all working images <-DONE

* option to leave working images (in a directory)

* encode parameters and store them somehow !!!!

* option to automatically compile frames into a movie (ffmpeg to gif




* use the Python bindings for ImageMagick to produce the input
  patterns and output GIFs
